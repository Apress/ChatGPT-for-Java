Using the information in the story below, who didn't get any ice cream and why?
###
In the city of Buttersville,USA on Milkmaid street, there’s a group of three friends: Marion Yogurt, Janelle de Queso, and Steve Cheeseworth III. On a hot summer’s day, they heard the music from an ice cream truck, and decided to buy something to eat. 

Marion likes strawberries, Janelle prefers chocolate, and Steve is lactose intolerant. That day, only two kids ate ice cream, and one of them bought a bottle of room-temperature water. The ice cream truck was fully stocked with the typical flavors of ice cream.
